📱 Mobile Phones Brands and Prices Analysis

A complete Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Web Scraping, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Regular Expressions, and Web Scraping techniques.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing mobile phone prices across various brands to understand how different specifications influence pricing.
The dataset is created by web scraping phone details from online retail websites, followed by cleaning and detailed exploratory analysis.

🎯 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to identify patterns and relationships between mobile phone features (RAM, storage, camera quality, battery, display size, ratings) and their price.
This analysis helps understand which specifications impact price the most and how brands position their products in the market.
